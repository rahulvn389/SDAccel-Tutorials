# Practice and Experiment with RTL Kernels

Apply and practice what you've learned in the earlier steps of this guide by running more hands-on examples. Familiarize yourself with online resources relating to the SDAccel™ environment, and make your way to the [AWS forum](https://forums.aws.amazon.com/forum.jspa?forumID=243) to search for knowledge and find answers.

## Experiment with Other Examples

Running and experimenting with the following three examples of RTL kernels will help you further familiarize yourself with the RTL kernel flow.

#### Example 1: Vector Addition with two Clocks

This example shows vector addition performed by an RTL kernel with two clocks and the use of the `--kernel_frequency` XOCC option.

Download and run [this example](https://github.com/Xilinx/SDAccel_Examples/tree/2018.2/getting_started/rtl_kernel/rtl_vadd_2clks) from the SDAccel GitHub repository.



#### Example 2: Vector Addition with two Kernels

This example shows how create an accelerated design using more than one RTL Kernel. In this example, Vector Addition is performed with two kernels (Kernel_0 and Kernel_1) which perform vector addition. Kernel_1 reads the output from Kernel_0 as one of two inputs.

Download and run [this example](https://github.com/Xilinx/SDAccel_Examples/tree/2018.2/getting_started/rtl_kernel/rtl_vadd_2kernels) from the SDAccel GitHub repository.

#### Example 3: High-Performance Matrix Multiply with precompiled XO file and advanced Vivado™ implementation options

This example implements a high-performance matrix multiplication of two input matrices (A*B=C). The matrix multiplication kernel operates on matrices of type int16 and produces int16 results. Internally, the kernel has a systolic array of 2048 DSP units and is attached to two DDR banks. The DSP array runs at 400 MHz, whereas the logic around the array runs at 300 MHz.

Download and run [this example](https://github.com/Xilinx/SDAccel_Examples/tree/2018.2/acceleration/high_perf_mat_mult) from the SDAccel GitHub repository.
