# Practice and Experiment with C/OpenCL Kernels

Apply and practice what you've learned in the earlier steps of this guide by running more hands-on examples. Familiarize yourself with online resources relating to the SDAccel™ environment, and make your way to the [AWS forum](https://forums.aws.amazon.com/forum.jspa?forumID=243) to search for knowledge and find answers.

## Experiment with Other Examples

Running and experimenting with these three examples of the C/OpenCL™ kernels allows you to further familiarize yourself with good coding practices and kernel optimization techniques.

### Loop Pipelining
This example demonstrates how loop pipelining can be used to improve the performance of a kernel.

Download and run [this example](https://github.com/Xilinx/SDAccel_Examples/tree/2018.2/getting_started/kernel_opt/loop_pipeline_ocl) from the SDAccel GitHub repository.

### Reordering Loops
This example demonstrates how loop reordering can be used to improve the performance of a kernel.

Download and run [this example](https://github.com/Xilinx/SDAccel_Examples/tree/2018.2/getting_started/kernel_opt/loop_reorder_c) from the SDAccel GitHub repository.

### Loop Fusion
This example demonstrates how to fuse two loops into one to improve the performance of an OpenCL kernel.

Download and run [this example](https://github.com/Xilinx/SDAccel_Examples/tree/2018.2/getting_started/kernel_opt/loop_fusion_c) from the SDAccel GitHub repository.

### Additional Examples
The Xilinx Github repository contains more than 80 examples to help you learn. Browse the repository to find more examples of interest, starting with more coding and optimization examples.
